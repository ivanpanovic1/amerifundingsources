                                        Although conventional funding is scarce, there is an excess of funding available in the private sector and <strong>AmeriFunding Sources</strong> knows exactly where it is.

                                    <h4>What Is Private Money?</h4>    
                                    <p>
                                        <img src="img/what-is-private-money.png" style="float: left;" />
                                        Private Money is capital lent by private citizens or companies throughout the United States. It could be a close relative, like your Uncle Bob, or a complete stranger outside of your state. Regardless of who it is, Private Money is an absolute necessity in being successful in any real estate market.<br><br>
                                        <span class="red">Private Money usually has shorter terms and a clearly defined repayment schedule. </span>
                                        Terms for these types of loans will vary from lender to lender and will depend upon the experience level of an investor, as well as the length of an investor's relationship with a particular lender. Therefore, there are really no hard and fast rules to Private Money.
                                    </p> 
                                    <br>
                                    <hr />
                                    <br>
                                    <h4>Why Use Private Money?</h4>    
                                    <p>
                                        <img src="img/why-use-private-money.png" style="float: left;" />
                                        The most successful real estate investors, who are closing multiple deals each and every month, use Private Money on a regular basis. Even <strong>HUGE</strong> money magnates like Donald Trump prefer to use private funding over their own money. Why tie up their own capital if they don't have to, right?<br><br>
                                        In this economy, Private Money is easier to find, faster to get your hands on, and makes real estate investment more profitable and realistic. And <em>AmeriFunding Sources</em> takes it one step further and brings lenders to nationwide borrowers. Its proprietary formula has helped hundreds of real estate investors realize their financial dreams!

                                    <p>
                                        <img src="img/private-money-exchange-is-fast.png" style="float: left;" />
                                        As opposed to bank loans, AmeriFunding Sources is FAST!<br><br>
                                        You have most likely already experienced the snail's pace borrowing from a conventional lender. Unfortunately, with most of the good, extremely profitable deals on the market, there is no time for involved paperwork, credit checks, or paycheck verification.<br><br>
                                        Usually private money lenders won't request all of this information and if they do, <span class="green">the process is less strenuous and laborious because they are lending on the property's potential, rather than the person's background.</span> That's why borrowing private money through AmeriFunding Sources often goes more smoothly and quickly. If you have a good deal, finding money is the easy part.
                                    </p>

                                        If you have a pock mark on your credit score, it can be the difference between life and death in your ability to find funds from a conventional source. <span class="green">Banks are now requiring close-to-perfect credit scores before they lend out any money. Not so with AmeriFunding Sources.</span><br><br>
                                        Although <em>AmeriFunding Sources </em>will often want to see a financial statement of some kind, we do it more to review your past real estate experience. A lower credit score will mean very little if you can prove a savvy investing background.<br><br>
                                        Along with experience, the best thing about <em>AmeriFunding Sources</em> is that it doesn't look at past bankruptcies or credit problems. It focuses on the <strong>merit of the property</strong>. If it is a low-risk, high-yielding investment then you're more likely to get the loan! This is nice to know if you haven't always been an angel with your finances!

                                        Luckily, AmeriFunding is everywhere and you're not limited to financial institutions to find it. In fact there is over <strong>16 TRILLION</strong> dollars in private accounts in the United States alone.<br><br>
                                        Another solid plus in this realm of financing is that there are as many Private Money Niche Lenders as there are niche investments in the AmeriFunding Sources Network! If you're interested in commercial properties, like apartment buildings or strip malls, <strong>you'll find eager investors ready to help you capitalize on these types of deals.</strong> If you're interested in single-family investment opportunities, you'll find hundreds, if not thousands of individual private money lenders climbing over each other to lend you the cash needed to secure these types of properties.

With AmeriFunding Sources you know more about Private Money, and therefore you're better at parleying the best terms for you and your property.

Once you've arranged and closed several deals, you'll begin to think and finance your deals like a bank.
