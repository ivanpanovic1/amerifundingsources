                        <h1>Sell Your Home Fast</h1>
                        <div class="intro-text">New, Easy Sell-It-Yourself Sales Method Attracts Eager, Motivated Home Buyers Like A Steel-Magnet</div>
                        <p>The secret to selling your home fast, lies hidden in a little-know quick sales technique. It can sell your home in record time. It produces highly motivated buyers. The method is simple to apply, and easy as mowing the lawn.</p>
                        <p>But the strategy is rarely used. That's why you've probably never heard of it. Sales agents won't tell you much about it. If they do they'll lose listings. However, no sales agent is needed. That's the wonder of it.</p>
                        <p>In fact, the government says around 15% of homes for sale use this speedy sales strategy. The rest are at the mercy of soft economies, or slow real estate markets. Homes in the 15% category always sell quickly in spite of market conditions.</p>
                        <p>Home sellers in the 15% category don't work much harder selling their home. Once you apply this tested strategy, you'll begin to produce anxious buyers. These buyers are eager. They want to make a deal quickly.</p>
                        <p>I'm not kidding. You could have the finest home on the block. If you try selling it the slow, aggravating way average home sellers use, it can be upsetting. Almost as frustrating as riding a tricycle on the freeway.</p>
                        <p>Now don't worry. Stay with us. We'll teach you how to sell your house quickly. Just like the fast selling 15%. It's a unique sell-it-yourself method. And its quick, easy and safe.</p>
                        <h4>Imagine yourself with this problem</h4>
                        <p>Put yourself inside this personal experience. You have a house you need to sell. You want to sell it yourself and save money. You face a huge financial debt. Plus, you have a deadline to meet. So you desperately need fast sales action.</p>
                        <p>
                            You get some sales advice from a friend. Then you put your house on the market. Things go as slow as "molasses in January". It's agonizing. There's some interest from potential buyers, but they have to check with their bank. The
delays, hassles and red tape seemed endless. The whole process drives you nuts. It's like being forced into a corner.
                        </p>
                        <p>Two weeks later, a home down the street from your's is put up for sale. It sells in less then a month. This amazes you. Your home is more deluxe. Dollar for dollar it's a better value. It has a good location, and is well advertised. Yet the home down the street sold quickly. What is a person supposed to do?</p>
                        <h4>The Answer To Your Problem</h4>
                        <p>You get the answer when a man named Leonard calls on your house. Leonard doesn't want to buy the house. He isn't a sales agent. But he has plenty of experience selling homes he'd owned before.</p>
                        <p>Leonard reveals something to you that's astounding. He says, "you're blocking people from buying your house. That's why your home isn't selling". You're outraged. You ask, "is there something wrong with my house"?</p>
                        <p>Leonard explains the problem isn't the house. You've got to blast away barriers stopping people from buying it. Leonard says, "the biggest barrier is the highly regulated banking industry. Good home buyers get turned down all the time for financing. Its caused by the rigid guidelines banks require to get</p>
                        <p>"Most of these buyers have decent jobs, reasonable credit, and have the ability to pay for a home. These are the people you want to sell too".</p>
                        <p>Leonard says, "the average seller stops good buyers from purchasing their house. Their not aware of a powerful marketing technique. It's a simple technique that crushes the barrier. The strategy creates sales motivation immediately in buyers. It makes selling your home seem like a breeze".</p>
                        <p>You ask Leonard, "is it important to advertise the features of the home? Perhaps have an open house". Leonard explains those methods have their place. However, when you use this sales strategy, you'll get sales results faster than any method used on the planet.</p>
                        <p>The sales results can be dramatic. It sends a powerful message to every buyer that's loud and clear. "ITS EASY TO BUY THIS HOUSE".</p>
                        <h5>Eager Buyers Compete To Buy Your House</h5>
                        <p>You instantly realize you've discovered a phenomenal "secret sales weapon". Your house will be irresistible to buyers.</p>
                        <p>You began to apply the strategy. The results are amazing. You can't believe how easy it is. In fact, it seems to easy.</p>
                        <p>But when you find out the house down the street, that sold in less than a month, had used the same strategy, you realize it isn't just luck.</p>
                        <p>The sales strategy requires you to make some changes in your newspaper ad. Then you run it in the next edition of the paper. The morning the ad comes out, you're not able to shower and shave until noon. The calls are so steady. You have to hold an all day open house to accommodate all the interest. Can you imagine, you have as many as 4 people looking at the house at the same time</p>
                        <p>Talk about competition. 4 people want the house. There's only one house to buy. If you'd had 4 houses you could have probably sold them all.</p>
                        <p>We're probably bragging a little. But we have to admit the attention is awesome. The best part is you get what you want. A fast sale, for market value, and all cash.</p>
                        <h5>Leonard's Secret Sales Strategy Is Shared with Others</h5>
                        <p>A few weeks after you sold your home, a friend asks if she could sell her house the same way. You tell her about Leonard's "secret sales weapon".</p>
                        <p>Leonard outlines the strategy, and even makes some improvements. She finds it simple to follow. And marvels how easy it is to get the same sales results as you.</p>
                        <p>The next time someone approaches Leonard, he's written an entire volume on the easy way to copy the sales results. </p>
                        <p>It's written in simple, easy to understand language.</p>

                        <h4>Here's What's Being Said About This Program</h4>
                        <p>I sold my rental home to the first couple who looked at it. I had it up for sale for only 10 days, and I received over 100 calls in the 1st week from following your methods of advertising. I had been so busy with work that I didn't have time to even show it, or call people back for the 1st 10 days. It cost me $50 in all for advertising. My rental unit had been rented out for 3 years with no repair during that time. As a result, it needed $10,000 in repair. I didn't even have to repair anything, your methods found me a buyer that paid me $2000.00 over the appraised price.</p>

                                    Answer:  No. You should never sell your home with no-money-down.

                                    Answer:  Yes. You can sell a condo, town house, duplex, or apartments using this method. In addition, It works well for commercial property.

                                    Answer:  The strategy pretty much sells your home on its own. The only work involved is getting your house ready to sell. Cleaning and painting etc.

                                    Answer:  When you place an ad using the strategy, your phone will start ringing quickly. We've seen people put a for-sale sign in their front yard and get instant results with the strategy.

                                <div class="content" id="panel5b">
                                    Answer:  No. This strategy gives you the advantage of a sellers market. Getting market value for your home is no problem. Sometimes if your home needs repair, your price may need some adjustment. Otherwise, market value can easily be obtained.

                                    Answer:  No. This strategy produces an outright cash sale.

                                <div class="content" id="panel7b">
                                    Answer:  Yes. However, its best to put your home in good condition. You'll get a better price. No matter what condition, location, or sales price, every home will always have a number of interested buyers. This strategy makes your home stand out over similar homes to yours. Why? Buyers will realize its easier to buy your house over other similar homes when you use the strategy.

                                    Answer:  No.  However, you could use a bidding method with the strategy if you want.

                                    Answer: Yes. Line up a good real estate lawyer to help you close the sale. Don't prepare sales documents on your own. A good real estate attorney will protect you.
